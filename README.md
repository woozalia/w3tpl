Woozle's Wacky Wiki Text Processing Language

Yes, the name is terrible. Suggest a better one...

Main documentation is at http://htyp.org/W3TPL

It ends up largely being useful for a few specific tasks:
* prototyping simple extensions
* managing small extensions that don't need a Special page
* hiding SemanticMediaWiki markup with <hide> so I don't have to use the more complex non-displayed format
* report templates

The original plan was to have both tags and a scripting language but so far the tags have done everything I needed them for, so developing the language has been low-priority.
